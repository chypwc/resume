## Experience

**E-commerce ETL & RAG AI Agent** [github.com/InsightFlow8/insightflow](https://github.com/InsightFlow8/insightflow)

*Description:*
- Built an end-to-end ETL pipeline and AI-powered recommendation system for an e-commerce platform.
- The project automated data ingestion, transformation, and analytics to enable customer behaviour insights and personalised product recommendations.
- Agile practices followed with Jira and Confluence for sprint planning and documentation.

*Key Responsibilities / Achievements:*
- Designed and deployed ETL pipelines on AWS using Step Functions orchestrating Lambda, Glue Spark jobs, and Crawlers; implemented partitioned S3 Data Lake for scalable storage and Athena for analytics.
- Built a Streamlit dashboard (Docker + EC2) with FastAPI backend for real-time customer behaviour analysis, marketing insights, and AI-driven recommendations.
- Developed a RAG-based chatbot using LangChain and FastAPI; integrated ALS models and S3Vectors vector database for semantic product embeddings, similarity search, and personalised recommendations.
- Automated CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and IaC with Terraform.

**Real-Time Inference** [github.com/chypwc/kinesis-webui](https://github.com/chypwc/kinesis-webui)
- Engineered a serverless real-time recommendation system using Lambda, API Gateway, Kinesis, and DynamoDB for low-latency XGBoost predictions via RESTful APIs.
- Preprocessed data with Glue Spark and automated ML training and deployment on SageMaker, all orchestrated through Step Functions.
- Enabled global delivery with CloudFront; automated provisioning with Terraform and GitHub Actions.

**DMS + EMR Data Pipeline** [github.com/chypwc/aws-dms-emr-terraform](https://github.com/chypwc/aws-dms-emr-terraform)
- Automated ingestion and transformation from PostgreSQL into Apache Iceberg on S3 using AWS DMS, EMR Spark, and Glue Catalog.
- Orchestrated end-to-end processing with AWS MWAA (Airflow), Terraform-generated DAGs, and GitHub Actions CI/CD.

**dbt–Glue ETL** [github.com/chypwc/aws-resources-exercises](https://github.com/chypwc/aws-resources-exercises)
- Implemented a scalable ETL pipeline by integrating Glue Jobs, Crawlers, and dbt-glue for SQL-based transformations; ingested Snowflake data into S3 (Parquet), cataloged with Glue, and transformed into features.
- Automated infrastructure and deployments using CloudFormation and GitHub Actions CI/CD, orchestrating ingestion, catalog updates, and dbt transformation runs end-to-end.

**Research Assistant** — ANU RSE (Oct 2024 – May 2025), Canberra
- Structured raw datasets into panel format using STATA and Python.
- Built OCR pipelines to extract text from scanned documents.
- Conducted statistical analysis and literature reviews for labour economics projects.

**Tutor** — ANU RSE (Feb 2019 – Nov 2024), Canberra
- Delivered tutorials and consultations across core economics subjects: mathematical methods, optimisation, macroeconomics, growth, and time-series forecasting (MATLAB).
- Taught econometrics with Python, focusing on statistical modelling and applied regression/causal inference.
- Led discussions on dynamic programming and general equilibrium; supported 500+ students across 20+ tutorials.
